**AIRPORTS**

As of January 2017, the OpenFlights Airports Database contains over 10,000 airports, train stations and ferry terminals spanning the globe, as shown in the map above. Each entry contains the following information:
Airport ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airport.

Name	Name of airport. May or may not contain the City name.
City	Main city served by airport. May be spelled differently from Name.
Country	Country or territory where airport is located. See countries.dat to cross-reference to ISO 3166-1 codes.
IATA	3-letter IATA code. Null if not assigned/unknown.
ICAO	4-letter ICAO code. Null if not assigned.
Latitude	Decimal degrees, usually to six significant digits. Negative is South, positive is North.
Longitude	Decimal degrees, usually to six significant digits. Negative is West, positive is East.
Altitude	In feet.
Timezone	Hours offset from UTC. Fractional hours are expressed as decimals, eg. India is 5.5.
DST	Daylight savings time. One of E (Europe), A (US/Canada), S (South America), O (Australia), Z (New Zealand), N (None) or U (Unknown). See also: Help: Time
Tz database time zone	Timezone in "tz" (Olson) format, eg. "America/Los_Angeles".
Type	Type of the airport. Value "airport" for air terminals, "station" for train stations, "port" for ferry terminals and "unknown" if not known. In airports.csv, only type=airport is included.
Source	Source of this data. "OurAirports" for data sourced from OurAirports, "Legacy" for old data not matched to OurAirports (mostly DAFIF), "User" for unverified user contributions. In airports.csv, only source=OurAirports is included.

The data is UTF-8 (Unicode) encoded.

Note: Rules for daylight savings time change from year to year and from country to country. The current data is an approximation for 2009, built on a country level. Most airports in DST-less regions in countries that generally observe DST (eg. AL, HI in the USA, NT, QL in Australia, parts of Canada) are marked incorrectly.

**AIRLINES**

Airline ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airline.
Name	Name of the airline.
Alias	Alias of the airline. For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known as "ANA".
IATA	2-letter IATA code, if available.
ICAO	3-letter ICAO code, if available.
Callsign	Airline callsign.
Country	Country or territory where airline is incorporated.
Active	"Y" if the airline is or has until recently been operational, "N" if it is defunct. This field is not reliable: in particular, major airlines that stopped flying long ago, but have not had their IATA code reassigned (eg. Ansett/AN), will incorrectly show as "Y".

The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded. The special value \N is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.

Notes: Airlines with null codes/callsigns/countries generally represent user-added airlines. Since the data is intended primarily for current flights, defunct IATA codes are generally not included. For example, "Sabena" is not listed with a SN IATA code, since "SN" is presently used by its successor Brussels Airlines.


**ROUTES**

Airline	2-letter (IATA) or 3-letter (ICAO) code of the airline.
Airline ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for airline (see Airline).
Source airport	3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the source airport.
Source airport ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for source airport (see Airport)
Destination airport	3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the destination airport.
Destination airport ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for destination airport (see Airport)
Codeshare	"Y" if this flight is a codeshare (that is, not operated by Airline, but another carrier), empty otherwise.
Stops	Number of stops on this flight ("0" for direct)
Equipment	3-letter codes for plane type(s) generally used on this flight, separated by spaces

The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded. The special value \N is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.

Notes: 
Routes are directional: if an airline operates services from A to B and from B to A, both A-B and B-A are listed separately.
Routes where one carrier operates both its own and codeshare flights are listed only once.
